# You're done!

It's time to eat! 

Some folks prefer to discard the stew liquid and eat just the vegetables. I prefer to save the stew b/c it absorbs the vitamins and minerals from the food as it cooks.

You can save whatever you don't eat in the fridge or freezer. I prefer to save the stew in a separate container from the meat.
