 1. 1 large zucchini -- cut into quarters lengthwise, then sliced
 1. 1 large yellow squash -- cut into quarters lengthwise, then sliced
 1. 5 ears corn -- cut off from the cob
 1. 2 russet potatoes -- peeled and cut into 1/4-inch cubes

## Ingredients: Spice / flavor
1. 5 cups low-sodium chicken broth

## Ingredients: Dairy
1. 2 cups half and half or whole milk

# Preparation

## Cook the bacon

1. Put the Dutch over medium heat
1. Add bacon bits
1. Cook until crisp, stirring periodically: *about 5 minutes*
1. You want the grease to coat the bottom of the pan

## The chowder base

Slowly add all of the vegetables to the pot in this order

_All times are estimates_ -- please use your best judgement

1. Add Onion & celery: *3 minutes* or until not crisp
1. Add Corn: *4 minutes*
1. Add Garlic: *1 minute* or until fragrant
1. Add Chicken broth
    1. Increase heat to medium-high
    1. *Wait until simmering*
1. Add Potatoes
1. Add all of the spices
    1. Reduce heat to medium
1. Cook for *10 minutes*
1. Add Zucchini
1. Wait until potatoes are tender: *about 10 minutes*

## Finish it off
1. Transfer 2 cups of chowder to a food processor or blender
    1. Doing this reduces the quantity of heavy cream necessary to thicken the chowder
    1. The amount you transfer is flexible. The more you blend, the less "chowdery" the final chowder will be
1. Puree until silky smooth: *about 1-2 minutes*
1. Return the mixture to the pot
1. Add the half and half / milk
1. Stir to combine
1. Remove from the heat
1. Let the chowder sit for 10 minutes before serving
