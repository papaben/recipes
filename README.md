# Recipes

A collection of recipes of meals that I may or may not have eaten

# Why?

I often struggle to follow along with recipes that I find online. All of the information is present, but it's not arranged in a way that makes it easy for me to follow _as I'm cooking_. Most of these recipes are restructured from recipes that I have found online. The other benefit is that I'm not assaulted by flashing ads and videos when all I want to do is try to scroll with my greasy, oily, raw meat covered, or otherwise dirty fingers.
